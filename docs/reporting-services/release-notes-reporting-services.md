# Release notes for SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2017 and later

[!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto](../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-2017-and-later](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2017-and-later.md)]

This article describes changes in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] (SSRS), for versions 2017 and later.

For the release notes for Report Viewer controls, see [Release Notes for the Report Viewer controls for WebForms and WinForms of SSRS](application-integration/release-notes-ssrs-application-integration.md).

<!--
We are "standardizing" all our 'Release Notes' style articles:

  - File names:   'release-notes-[TechArea-Name].md'


  - Content format:   2-column tables.  No longer using bullet lists.

    - Ideally, the 'Details' column should contain a link to another SSRS documentation article wherein the particular issue fix is discussed in any way.  Or if there is more to say beyond one sentence, the other sentences of elaboration would go into the 'Details' column.


  - H2 header names are kept short, for better display.


  - Try to keep all Release Notes in one .md file.  Avoid having multiple R.N. files whose names differ only by version or date.

    - Seriously consider erasing info about ancient releases that are so old that nobody cares about them anymore.  If you really want to retain ancient info, consider doing so in an HTML comment at the end of the .md file, just in case a Microsoft employee needs to re-examine ancient info.  In any case, this file cannot get ever longer, and some deletion or hiding of oldest info must eventually occur.


  - Do use '::: moniker range=' zones when version 2017 is no longer the only version represented inside this .md file.

    - Use the '=' operator on the moniker, not the '>=' operator.
    - In contrast, in our 'Whats New' articles we do use the '>=', rather than '='.
